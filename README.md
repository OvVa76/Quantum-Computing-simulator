# Quantum-Computing-simulator
C# based Quantum computing simulator, that can mix up classical code with quantum operations
In order to use it, a basic understanding of quantum computing concepts is necessary
This simulator does not rely on visual manipulation of qubits like the IMB quantim experience simulator, 
but instead lets the user create virtual qbits nd manipulate them like any other objects
Just create a C# console app, copy the code in and run it
